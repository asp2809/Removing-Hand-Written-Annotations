# Removing Hand-Written Annotations

The Project consists of mainly three sections:
- <a href="/Underline-Removal">Underline</a>
- <a href="/Strikethrough-Removal">Strike-through Removal</a>
- <a href="/Text Correction">Text Correction</a>

Based on the above process, we are able to generate approximately correct text from an image consisting of Hand-Drawn Underlines and Strike-throughs.

Some of the sample results can be found <a href="/Results">here</a>.
